Initially, it was a thick brown belt to hold his Zanpakutō sheath, but it later became a red rosary-like strap after awakening his own Shinigami powers.[13] It is shaped like a kite with a flat top and bottom.[14] Ichigo's appearance has caused several people, including Jūshirō Ukitake, to note a similarity to Kaien Shiba, the former lieutenant of the 13th Division.[15] After training in the Dangai, Ichigo's hair grows considerably, and he is noticeably taller, as stated by his friends.[16] After Ichigo loses his Shinigami powers, his appearance reverts to the way it was before his Dangai training.[17]"
