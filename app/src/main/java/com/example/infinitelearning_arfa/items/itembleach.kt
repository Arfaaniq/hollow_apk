He has two beady black eyes and small ears with pink inside of them. His head is surprisingly flat when viewed from the side and he has a brown, spiky mane atop his head. Hanging from his lower back is a small tail.[5][6]\n" +

In this enlarged form he sports large and well-defined muscular physique. Kon can also be reverted to his original appearance via a remote.[7]"

He likes to wear slim fitting clothes.[10] He has a tendency to wear shirts patterned with the number 15 because his name is a homonym for the number.[11] Since becoming a Shinigami, he has become noticeably more muscular, as noted by his sister Karin.[12] When in his spiritual form, Ichigo wears the standard Shinigami shihakushō, with the addition of a strap across his chest. Initially, it was a thick brown belt to hold his Zanpakutō sheath, but it later became a red rosary-like strap after awakening his own Shinigami powers.[13] It is shaped like a kite with a flat top and bottom.[14] Ichigo's appearance has caused several people, including Jūshirō Ukitake, to note a similarity to Kaien Shiba, the former lieutenant of the 13th Division.[15] After training in the Dangai, Ichigo's hair grows considerably, and he is noticeably taller, as stated by his friends.[16] After Ichigo loses his Shinigami powers, his appearance reverts to the way it was before his Dangai training.[17]"
